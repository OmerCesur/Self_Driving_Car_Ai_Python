# Self_Driving_Car_Ai_Python

Introducing my recent project, Self Driving Car, where i have developed a self driving car using CNN module and DQN for ai with python. Additionally, my project includes a map that allows the user to draw the car's path and draw walls to ensure the car avoids obstacles. 
By clicking buttons map can be reset, ai brain can be save and load, graphs can be view to inspect ai brain. 

With **app.py** can run app and test app.
